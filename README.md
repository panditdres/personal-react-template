The template is fairly straight forward, it included a couple of fonts as well as some components for a basic Landing page. Button and modal components are there as well as input fields and text area. 

Currently still a work in progress and will add more components as the project goes along.

So far, only the client side is available, server side will be made later if needed (Node implementation)
